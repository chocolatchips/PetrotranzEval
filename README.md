# PetrotranzEval
This project contains the code for the Petrotranz Interview Programming Evaluation

## Assumptions
The assumptions made for this evaluation are as follows:
- All arguments are passed through command line arguments when running the program
- The words and characters counted are between the *** Start of project *** and *** End of project *** lines
- Whitespace characters are counted when in the character totals
- Words separated by double hyphens are considered two words
- Words are output by order of descending frequency

## Tools Used
The following tools were used:
- Visual Studio Code
- Notpad++ and Microsoft Word for counting words and characters
- https://www.online-utility.org/text/analyzer.jsp for most frequent words
- http://www.regexstorm.net/tester for regex testing
